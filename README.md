## âœ¨ Hello there, I'm Kiara âœ¨

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub! I'm currently diving deep into the world of code, exploring GitHub's many features, and building my confidence one commit at a time.

ðŸ”­ Right now, I'm focused on mastering GitHub workflows and understanding how version control empowers collaboration.

ðŸŒ± I'm learning how to use Visual Studio with Python, and getting comfortable with pushing and pulling from remote repositories.

ðŸ’¬ Thanks for stopping by! I'm still really new to all of this, and honestly, Iâ€™m just trying to figure things out as I go. Thereâ€™s a lot to learn, but Iâ€™m excited (and a little nervous) to keep exploring. Hope to keep improving as I go!  ðŸŒ±ðŸ’»
